CI  is the process of automatically testing and combining small pieces of code
CD is the automated process of packaging up your tested code and delivering it to your users
PUTTING ALL THINGS TOGETHER 
Making ci cd possible is done using an automated process, that is called pipeline

CRICKET MATCH
CI --->
TOOLS:
1.VCS(GIT, GITHUB,GITLAB)
2.CI/CD: (JENKINS,DOCKER)
3.TESTING :(PYTEST,JEST)
4.DEPLOYMENT (KEBERNETES,ANSIBLE)

pipeline:
Automated series of steps 
checkout code
install dependencies
run tests
(deploy)


BASIC STRUCTURE:
pipeline is stored in folder
.github/workflows/*.yml

workflow has 4 main parts
1.name : name of workflow
2. on : push
        - branch main
        - other branches
     
pull request
3. Jobs: whats tasks workflow will done
4. steps:
    setup python
 run pytest 
 name : run tests


test_file.py 



#HOW IT WORKS
when you push code to github
it starts pipeline
it runs each step in yml test_file
install depenedencies
install packages
run tests
result :
fail(red) of pass(green)
